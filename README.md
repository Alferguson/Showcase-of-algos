# Showcase of Algorithms and Data Structures

This website using the React framework will showcase the algorithms and data structures I have completed and will continue to complete. Problems will be sorted into what category they are apart of and code snippets will be shown in JavaScript (and maybe Rust as that is the other language I am learning)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo to your local machine with

```
git clone git_repo_url
```

2. Naviagate to the project's root and run

```
npm install
```

3. Then run

```
npm start
```

### Prerequisites

Node and NPM have to be installed. Otherwise, the other dependencies are installed via NPM

## Running the tests

Unit and Integration Testing is done via Jest and React-Testing-Libary.
Functional Testing custom React Hooks is done via Jest and React-Hooks-Testing-Libary.

To start tests in watch mode, run

```
npm test
```

## Deployment

To deploy, first build the React app with

```
npm build
```

then run that build on any server

## Built With

- [Dropwizard](http://www.dropwizard.io/1.0.2/docs/) - The web framework used
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) - Dependency Management
- [ROME](https://rometools.github.io/rome/) - Used to generate RSS Feeds

## Acknowledgments

The [Creating a React App... From Scratch](https://blog.usejournal.com/creating-a-react-app-from-scratch-f3c693b84658) by Jedai Saboteur was very helpful as most of my projects use Create-React-App. I decided I wanted to try everything from scratch and his article was instrumental in me learning how, thank you!
